# Design-Patterns- C# and .NET
**Hands on Design Patterns in C# and .NET by Jayanta Dutta**

It's a standardized approach to solve common software design issues.
In software development, design patterns serve a similar purpose—they provide templated solutions to recurring problems, ensuring that you don't have to reinvent the wheel each time you encounter a familiar issue.

To select a pattern, we must first go through the problem identification. If the problem is related to:

Object Creation? → Creational Patterns

Object Assembly? → Structural Patterns

Object Interactions? → Behavioral Patterns

Most commonly used patterns:

Creational Design Pattern -> Creational patterns focus on instantiating an object or group of related objects.

Structural Patterns -> Structural patterns are primarily concerned with object composition or, in other words, how the entities can use each other.

Behavioral patterns -> They focus on distributing responsibility among the objects. They differ from structural patterns in that they define the patterns for message conveyance and communication between them in addition to the structure.
